### Implementation and files

`ttie/isp.py`: exposure, shifted gamma, RGB WB and contrast, shared by global 1x1 and spatial configurable bilinear grids. Physical EV bounds [-2,2], other coordinates [0.5,2], identity at raw zero. Six global versus 96 spatial parameters (4x4).

`ttie/adapt.py`: image + label-free loss callable API, fresh identity and Adam state for each episode, only raw ISP gradients/updates, returned image/raw grid/physical grid/full field and all step losses, gradient norms, coordinate ranges and finiteness.

`ttie/demo.py`: deterministic 64x96 RGB toy, left x0.45/right x1.55 with clipping, identity/global/spatial evaluation, full JSON/float tensor/PNG outputs. Fixed prior is mean((avg_pool2d(output,8)-0.5)^2), not derived from a clean target. Both adaptations complete before reference evaluation. No target/label argument in adaptation; the reference-replacement test changes evaluation MSE without changing adapted outputs or loss trajectories.

`tests/test_isp.py`, `tests/test_adapt.py`, `tests/test_demo.py`: 13 CPU tests. `scripts/run_a6000.sh`: remote CPU suite and CPU/CUDA/repeat experiment. `README.md`, `requirements.txt`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`: usage, conventions, minimal dependencies and shell LF policy. `research_log/`: working log, remote recovery instructions, exact test output and full experiment receipts/artifacts. No detector, CLIP, free pixel field, meta-learning, external dataset or future-task module added.

Local: Python 3.12.7, torch 2.13.0+cpu, Pillow 10.4.0. A6000: Python 3.12.12, torch 2.4.0+cu121, CUDA 12.1, Pillow 12.3.0. No local GPU available; CUDA was tested on the actual RTX A6000. Automated tests cover identity (including black/white), each operator's analytic value and finite nonzero gradient, spatial interpolation, global/constant-field equality, fast-only updates, episode reset, CPU, analytic metrics, deterministic full demo and clean-reference independence.

### Measured results (A6000 CUDA)

| Case | Self-supervised loss before | Loss after | MSE to clean (evaluation only) | PSNR dB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Identity | 0.07551638 | 0.07551638 | 0.07748476415872574 | 11.1078 |
| Global | 0.07551638 | 0.00623847 | 0.00988832302391529 | 20.0488 |
| Spatial 4x4 | 0.07551638 | 0.00078186 | 0.002459792885929346 | 26.0910 |

Spatial MSE is **75.12426647086426% lower** than global (+6.0422 dB). Left/right MSE: global 0.01418523/0.00559142, spatial 0.00243114/0.00248844. No NaN/Inf occurred in outputs, losses, gradients or physical fields. CPU versus CUDA spatial MSE differs by approximately 4.7e-10; duplicate CUDA tensors and reports are bitwise identical.

Learned global [EV, gamma, WB-R, WB-G, WB-B, contrast]: [-0.520365, 0.520844, 0.827869, 0.827636, 0.827754, 0.530883]. Spatial coordinate minima: [-0.789777, 0.592122, 0.738297, 0.738223, 0.738352, 0.566599]; maxima: [0.581452, 0.942055, 1.187374, 1.187655, 1.188322, 0.725919]. Full 4x4 physical grids and every step's ranges/gradient norm/loss are in JSON; full-resolution fields and raw parameters are in tensors.pt.

### Interpretation, deviations and failures

The specified controlled toy experiment supports the global-vs-spatial recovery hypothesis. It does **not** establish general natural-image restoration or downstream-task utility. The toy is centered near the fixed 0.5 statistical prior; this favorable match is explicit. That prior can flatten texture and real color and does not distinguish dark objects from exposure. Global output visibly loses contrast; spatial also has residual transition/texture error. 0.8681% of degraded pixels are clipped. Four operator roles are non-identifiable because exposure/WB/gamma/contrast can compensate. Final fixed-step outputs were evaluated; no clean-metric hyperparameter or checkpoint selection was performed.

No scientific scope deviation. Concrete choices within T001: default 4x4 physical grid, shifted power for finite black-pixel gamma gradients, Adam, fixed patch RGB-mean prior, direct fast-grid optimization (no token encoder/fast network).

Observed setup failures resolved: default remote shell lacked python (used verified interpreter and TTIE-local venv); Pillow absent in that venv (installed there); git author identity missing (set repository-local Codex identity). No failed scientific run or modified evaluation target. An existing environment protobuf deprecation warning did not affect tests. No external datasets, real detector experiments or broader benchmark validation were run, as excluded by T001.

### Communication and next step

Per user's additional instruction, created project `/home/wenchang/asdasdsad/wjq/TTIE` on the A6000 under the existing writable wjq directory. No TTIE job remains running. Code current release and run receipts remain there; full results are also local and in this PR.

Created ACTIVE Codex task heartbeat `ttie-chatgpt`, every 15 minutes. It reads main inbox/state and PR review feedback, continues authorized work, writes the Codex mailbox, avoids duplicate execution of reported tasks still marked OPEN, and stays quiet when unchanged. The user's ChatGPT hourly heartbeat is reported, not independently verified; the first future scheduled two-way exchange remains to be observed. GitHub is the synchronization channel, not a direct ChatGPT process-control API.

Recommended next step: research lead reviews PR #1, accepts or requests revisions, and publishes the next scoped task. Before interpreting broader recovery gains, consider a task on spatial parameterization with suitable texture-preservation and illumination/content-confound controls. These are suggestions only; no T002 or future modules implemented. Research lead retains ownership of task status and PROJECT_STATE.
